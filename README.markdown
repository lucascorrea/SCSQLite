The SCSQLite is a wrapper of SQLite in Objective-c. (http://sqlite.org/)


Getting Started
=================
Just drag the two classes into your project. Also you need to import SQLite3 framework. Go to frameworks-> add existing framework->libsql3.dylib

or

Using CocoaPods to get start, you can add following line to your Podfile:

	pod 'SCSQLite'

Example Usage
=============

To use the component is very easy. Import the header for your class.

	# import "SCSQLite.h" or #import <SCSQLite/SCSQLite.h> (cocoapods)
	
	//Init database 
	[SCSQLite initWithDatabase:@"myproject.db"];
	
	// To create, insert, update and delete use this method
	BOOL success = [SCSQLite executeSQL:@"INSERT INTO User (name, lastname) VALUES ('Lucas', 'Correa')"];
	
	//OR Vargs va_list
	BOOL success = [SCSQLite executeSQL:@"INSERT INTO User (name, lastname) VALUES (?, ?)", @"Lucas", @"Correa"];

	// To use this method select
	NSArray *result = [SCSQLite selectRowSQL:@"SELECT * FROM User"];
